The good intentions were there but in the HTML and Accessibility world, less is sometimes more.

## Bad code

```html
{{ badcode | pretty }}

## Issues and how to fix them


1. The `aria-label`, `placeholder`, and `title` attributes all provide the same informaton ("First name"), leading to the screenreader reading the same text multiple times.
1. The `aria-label` is unnecessary since the input is already correctly labeled by the `<label>` element. `<label>` elements should be preferred to `aria-label` since they are also visible to sighted users.
1. The `title` attribute is not needed here, as the label and placeholder already convey the necessary information. Using title in this context adds unnecessary complexity.
1. The `placeholder` text should provide a hint / example to the user what kind of input is expected, it should not act as a label or contain the same content.
