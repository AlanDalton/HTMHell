If I had a dollar for every time I've had to tell someone to remove an `aria-label` from an interactive control that has actual visible text, I could have bought Twitter! As a former developer and current accessibility consultant, it is my sincere hope that by reading this article, developers unfamiliar with or unsure about this topic will have a better understanding of the differences between `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`, and `aria-describedby`.  

Semantic HTML elements convey meaning - role and state - to browsers and assistive technologies. Whenever you **can** use an appropriate native HTML element, you **should** do so. For example, using a `<button>`, instead of using a generic element such as a `<div>` and then adding ARIA roles and states and properties and JavaScript functions and CSS to make it look and behave like a button, is a much better way to code. In fact, the [First Rule of ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/using-aria/#rule1) is: **Use HTML**. ([Credit for that paraphrase](https://twitter.com/stevefaulkner/status/1433774405797257222).)   

## When should I use ARIA to label something?  

Using this [priority of methods for labelling a control](https://adrianroselli.com/2020/01/my-priority-of-methods-for-labeling-a-control.html) list, first ask yourself, “do I really need to use ARIA here?” That is, can you add visible text to your element or programmatically associate existing text using native HTML semantics? There are multiple ways to do this; here are a few.    

### HTML `<label>` tag
Use the `for` attribute to tie a `<label>` to its input.  

```html
<label for="fname">First name:</label>  
<input type="text" id="fname">   

<label for="lname">Last name:</label>  
<input type="text" id="lname">  
```  

### HTML `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` tags
Use `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` tags to group and label radio button and checkbox sets.  

```html
<fieldset>  
	<legend>What is your favorite breakfast food?</legend>  

	<input type="radio" id="waffles" name="fav_breakfast" value="waffles">  
	<label for="waffles">Waffles</label>

	<input type="radio" id="pancakes" name="fav_breakfast" value="pancakes">  
	<label for="pancakes">Pancakes</label>

	<input type="radio" id="leftover_pizza" name="fav_breakfast" value="leftover_pizza">  
	<label for="pizza">Leftover Pizza</label>  
</fieldset> 
```  

### HTML `alt` attribute for images  
Use meaningful `alt` text for images, particularly when the image is the only content for a link or a button. The `alt` text in the next example is much more meaningful to a screen reader user for understanding the purpose of the link than simply describing the bags of money in the image would be.  

```html
<a href="/win-the-lottery">  
	<img src="bags-of-money.png" alt="How to win the lottery. Heaping bags of money to help prove the point.">  
</a>  
```

ARIA should be used only to enhance HTML when necessary, not to "fix" bad HTML. That being said, there are times when it may be necessary to clarify or supplement labeling for various elements in order to make them more accessible for users of assistive technologies such as screen reading or voice control software.   

There are some great tips on creating effective and user-friendly names in the tutorial [better accessible names](https://hidde.blog/better-accessible-names/) that apply to all methods of labeling.    

## Should I use `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`?   

<abbr title="too long, didn't read">TLDR</abbr>:  
- If text for the label is available somewhere on the page, use `aria-labelledby`.  
- If text for the label doesn't exist on the page, use `aria-label`.   

The `aria-label` attribute accepts a string of text as its value. The `aria-labelledby` attribute takes the value of one or more `id` attributes. It's especially important to understand that **both `aria-label` and `aria-labelledby` replace any existing label content** for assistive technologies. Let's go over some examples.   

### Appropriate uses of `aria-label`   

Interactive elements with informative icons or icon fonts that don't have accompanying text all need textual names to be accessible. Some examples are links to social media pages and icon-only buttons such as Print, Download, or Info. The `aria-label` attribute works great for these situations. Here, an icon is displayed using CSS for an otherwise empty link:     

```html
<a href="..." class="icon-facebook social-icon" aria-label="Facebook page"></a>
```

You know that "X" button in the corner of a modal? Please, give it an `aria-label`! The following example will overwrite the visible text content of "X" and announce as "Close," which definitely makes more sense than hearing "X".   

```html
<button aria-label="Close">X</button>
```

In some cases you could instead provide `alt` text that would create an appropriate button or link label (and get bonus points for following ARIA Rule #1!).   

```html
<button>
	<img src="system-icon-circle-x.png" alt="Close">
</button>  
```  

When there are multiple navigation areas on a page, adding an `aria-label` to each can help a screen reader user differentiate between the regions and better understand where they are on the page. Don't include the word "navigation" as that is already announced via the `<nav>` role.   

```html  
<nav aria-label="Primary"> ... </nav>  
<nav aria-label="Breadcrumbs"> ... </nav>  
<div role="navigation" aria-label="Footer"> ... </div>`   
```  

Make sure your `aria-label` value is meaningful. In this next example, the info button label essentially just describes the button's icon:  

```html  
<!-- don't do this -->  
<p>This makes me want to absquatulate.  
	<button aria-label="question mark">  
		<i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i>  
	</button>  
</p>  
```  
A much better solution would be to provide relevant content about what the info button does or why it's here:  

```html
<p>This makes me want to absquatulate.  
	<button aria-label="What does absquatulate mean?">  
		<i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i>  
	</button>  
</p>
```  

### Appropriate uses of `aria-labelledby`    

When suitable text for a label already exists elsewhere on the page, `aria-labelledby` is the preferred method for labeling (if you must use ARIA). Multiple `id` values from other elements are separated by a space within the `aria-labelledby`'s value to concatenate a single string of text.    

Suppose you have a series of news articles on a page, and each article has a link that says "Read more." You can use `aria-labelledby` to add more context in order to differentiate between these generic links. Since `aria-labelledby` will overwrite the visible text content of the link, you'll need to add the "Read more" text back in as well. 

```html
<h2 id="article1-heading">All About Dragons</h2>  
<p>I like dragons. Blah blah blah blah blah.</p>  
<p>  
	<a id="article1-read-more" aria-labelledby="article1-read-more article1-heading">Read more</a>  
</p>  
```  

This will result in the link being announced as "Read more All About Dragons." You could go one step better and [rewrite those "Read more" links to be more descriptive for everyone](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/learn-more-links/).   

## When should I skip ARIA for labeling?   

As has been noted by [Léonie Watson](https://www.tpgi.com/short-note-on-aria-label-aria-labelledby-and-aria-describedby/), [Steve Faulkner](https://html5accessibility.com/stuff/2020/11/07/not-so-short-note-on-aria-label-usage-big-table-edition/), [Eevis](https://eevis.codes/blog/2021-11-29/aria-label-is-not-always-the-answer/) and many others, these attributes do not work on every element. These labeling attributes are intended for:  
- interactive elements  
- structural elements with landmark roles  
- widgets with explicit roles   

Check out this [handy chart of ARIA roles and their requirements for naming](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/practices/names-and-descriptions/#x5-6-accessible-name-guidance-by-role).  

Adding an `aria-label` will overwrite any visible text label that already exists, and adding an `aria-labelledby` will overwrite any visible text *AND* any `aria-label` provided. In general, you don't want to add `aria-label` when an appropriate visible text label already exists.  

```html
<a href="about/" aria-label="About Us">About Us</a>
```  

At first glance, this may seem harmless and it won't throw an error in automated or likely even manual accessibility testing, but what about when your company goes international? You're setting your future-self up for extra work and more headaches when that redundant non-visible label doesn't get translated or updated.  

```html
<a href="about/" aria-label="About Us">Sobre Nosotros</a>
```  

Never, ever do this:  

```html
<button id="run-button-1" aria-label="Customize Report">Run Report</button>
```

Sighted users will see the button's visible text label of "Run Report", but screen reader users will hear the button's accessible name of "Customize Report". Presumably "Run" and "Customize" are two different actions!  

The problem in the previous example is not limited to screen reader users. Someone using voice control software might say "Run Report" to activate the control, but nothing will happen since that's not the accessible name. Voice control users will have to find a workaround when they need to perform the "Run" action that this button visibly indicates.   

The following examples show some additional inappropriate uses of `aria-label`; you may as well save yourself some coding keystrokes and time spent debugging, by **not** doing any of the following bad examples.     

### Non-interactive elements   
```html
<div aria-label="Product Group">...</div>
```

Don't put `aria-label` on a `<div>` or other non-interactive element without an explicit role; it does nothing but create tech debt.  
### Decorative images    
```html
<img src="decorative-image.jpg" aria-label="">
```

An empty `aria-label` attribute is not the same as an empty `alt` attribute. Use an empty `alt` attribute (`alt=""`) for decorative images.  

### Prohibited roles  
```html
<p aria-label="Causes of eye twitching"> ... </p>
```

HTML elements whose implicit roles prohibit the use of `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` are listed in the [current WAI-ARIA specifications](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#namefromprohibited).  

## What about `aria-describedby`?   

According to the [WAI-ARIA specification for aria-describedby](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-describedby), "a label should be concise, where a description is intended to provide more verbose information." Any `aria-describedby` content is announced by screen reading software after the element's label is read out.  

The `aria-describedby` attribute should be used to provide supplemental content to an element's label – in addition to the label – rather than to label it directly. Examples of this might be to provide "helper text" about input format or other requirements when completing a form field, or to associate an error message with a specific input.   

```html  
<label for="textbox-1">Date</label>  
<input type="text" id="textbox-1" aria-describedby="description-1">  
<span id="description-1">Use mm/dd/yyyy format</span>  
```  

The use of `aria-describedby` in this example will let all users know the format of the date to enter in this text input. This will announce to a screen reader user when focus is placed on the form field.  

```html  
<label for="username">Username</label>  
<input type="text" id="username" aria-describedby="username-error">  
<span id="username-error">Username is required</span>  
```  

In this example, `aria-describedby` will programmatically associate the error message with the text input field, which allows screen reader users to hear the error message when the form field is focused. Sighted users will see the error message next to the text input field when it appears.  

## No ARIA is better than bad ARIA!   

If in doubt, leave it out! Unfortunately, it's too common to find seemingly well-intentioned ARIA labels that actually make things worse for folks using assistive technologies. Meaningful and accurate labels can benefit everyone, including screen reader users, voice control users, users with cognitive issues, and all other users! 

Screen reader users don't need "extra" instructions like "click here to activate the button" or "extra" information such as "this is a checkbox" so don't add this type of content into element labels. ARIA labels are only available to browsers and screen reading software, and can cause frustration and extra work for a voice control user when a visible label that doesn't match the accessible name. Generally speaking, don't add labels using ARIA if it provides a different user experience to a particular user group. Don't treat users with a disability differently than you would treat other users.  

If something is important enough to add using ARIA, consider whether it should be added for all users. [Overuse or misuse of the `aria-label` attribute can be indicative of larger problems](https://ericwbailey.website/published/aria-label-is-a-code-smell/) within a code base or development processes. There is more than one way to write accessible code, but please be judicious in your use of ARIA for labeling purposes and just use native semantic HTML whenever possible.
