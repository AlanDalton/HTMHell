<p>While browsing Mastodon late one night, I came across this excellent blog post called <a href="https://whitep4nth3r.com/blog/html-is-all-you-need-to-make-a-website/">HTML is all you need to make a website</a>. It describes a few websites which are pure HTML. No CSS and no JS.</p>
<p>And I thought… do you even need HTML to make a website?</p>
<p>A few hours later, I launched the <a href="https://no-ht.ml">NO-HT.ML</a> website.  Proving, once and for all, that you <em>don't</em> need HTML to make a beautiful<sup id="fnref-44154-ugly"><a href="#fn-44154-ugly" class="" title="[You ain't got no alibi](https://youtu.be/I96LR5vqqqQ?t=15).">1</a></sup> responsive<sup id="fnref-44154-resp"><a href="#fn-44154-resp" class="" title="In that it generates a violent response from web designers.">2</a></sup>, and useful<sup id="fnref-44154-use"><a href="#fn-44154-use" class="" title="I assume it will be used as part of my insanity defence.">3</a></sup> website which everyone will love<sup id="fnref-44154-hn"><a href="#fn-44154-hn" class="" title="[For some value of everyone](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33645398).">4</a></sup>.</p>

</p>

<p>Go <a href="https://no-ht.ml">take a look and marvel at its magnificence</a> - then come back here to discuss its profound importance.</p>
<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>
<p>If you look at the source code, you'll see it uses a <em>tiny</em> scrap of (mostly) invalid markup to kick things off.</p>
<p><code>&lt;!doctype UNICODE&gt;</code> is a <em>fake</em> doctype. But it seems to be needed to convince some browsers into attempting to render the document.</p>
<p><code>&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;</code> is <em>real</em>. Without this, text encoding sniffing takes places and some browsers just displayed rubbish.</p>
<p><code>&lt;plaintext&gt;</code> is <em>also</em> a real HTML element. It was <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/plaintext">deprecated in HTML 2</a> back in the mid-1990s.  What's particularly interesting is that the element <em>cannot</em> be closed. If you manage to find a website which lets you post HTML, that can be particularly fun!</p>
<p>From there, the page starts with some ASCII art. There are loads of text generators around. I remember when it used to take hours to hand-draw things like that.</p>
<p>Next is a bunch of Unicode abuse. There are <em>loads</em> of "letter-like" shapes. They're included for compatibility with rendering mathematical and scientific documents.  There are also lots of punctuation marks - like bullets.</p>
<p>ASCII tables and flowcharts are pretty commonplace, although they sometimes go a bit wonky with non-fixed width characters.</p>
<p>And then, finally, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecibo_message">Arecibo message</a> using the <a href="https://unicodeplus.com/block/1F780">Geometric Shapes Extended Block</a>.</p>

<h2 id="is-this-useful">Is this useful?</h2>
<p>I've been reading "Reality is Broken" a book all about game design. In it, I found this quote:</p>
<blockquote>Playing a game is the voluntary attempt to overcome unnecessary obstacles<sup id="fnref-44154-cite"><a href="#fn-44154-cite" class="" title="Suits, The Grasshopper">5</a></sup>.</blockquote>
<p>It can be <em>fun</em> to give yourself arbitrary restrictions.  In programming, there's a game called <a href="https://code.golf/">Code Golf</a> - where players compete to solve a coding challenge in the fewest number of characters.</p>
<p>That's what's going on here. People are playing a game - the rules of which are "Do normal thing X without using normal thing Y".</p>
<p>I encourage all of you to play games. Go use your imagination to build something in a ridiculously restricted way. What do the constraints do to the way you express yourself? What sense of satisfaction do you get from successfully creating something in an impossible manner? What will you learn from experimentation?</p>
<p>But, above all, have fun and show off your beautiful messes.</p>
