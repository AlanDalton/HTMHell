When it comes to adding images on the web, you need to consider how to make them accessible and understandable to everyone.

Which means you need to include text alternatives to describe the image information or function.

Three options are:
1. Alternative Text
2. Long description
3. Caption

But how do you know which one to use? And when? Here's info to help you make that decision.

## Alternative Text

**Alternative text is a concise image text alternative** for screen reader users. It's not shown to sighted users unless the image doesn't load. 

Which can happen when someone has turned off images on their email application. Or they're using a slow connection.

<div data-demo="Example code">

```html
<img src="flickr.svg" alt="Flickr">
```

</div>

## Long Description

**Long descriptions are longer text alternatives** for [complex images](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/complex/), which are shown to both sighted and screen reader users.

An expand/collapse accordion below an image is one example of a long description. Another example is a text description below the image. 

Note: don't confuse the `longdesc` attribute with long description. [Longdesc is a deprecated/obsolete](https://caniuse.com/?search=longdesc) and should no longer be used. It doesn't work on VoiceOver or mobile screen readers.

<div data-demo="Example code">

```html
<img src="remote-workforce-infographic.jpg" alt="The Benefits of a Remote Workforce infographic with text description below">
<p>Text Version</p>
```

</div>

## Caption

**An image caption is visible to all users** and typically displays below the image. 

It's used to convey additional information about the image; it doesn't describe the image directly.

Image captions are optional and **should never be the same as alternative text**.

<div data-demo="Example code">

```html
<figure role="figure" aria-labelledby="figcaption">
  <img src="detroit-parade-clown.jpg" alt="Clown with bright red hair and multicolored costume hands out purple bead necklace to young child">
  <figcaption>Detroit Thanksgiving Day Parade 2022</figcaption>
</figure>
```

</div>
