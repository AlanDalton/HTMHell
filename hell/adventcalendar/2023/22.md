If we made bikes, the pedals would be the most prominent feature. We would log pedalling to make pedalling-increasing pedals and claim that bikers don’t mind pedalling as long as it has meaning. We would talk about the importance of being biker-centric while also having inspirational galleries with the shiniest, newest call-to-pedal pedals – with breaks to match. And, of course, discuss if pedal-people should know how chains work.

<!-- Manuel:
"If we made bikes" <- who? developers? -->

<!-- Eric: I'm afraid you already lost me. We do quantify effort and exertion in biking, for exercise, racing, and pleasure. Bike culture also has all the qualities you outline. I think you need to have a paragraph before this one that outlines what you're speaking to technically, and then transition to the bike metaphor. -->

I’m a huge fan of humans being able to understand the world by deriving meaning from recognising objects, affordance indicators and circumstances; most of our understanding and communication happen through implication. I’m also a fan of humans being *allowed* to understand. Most things aren’t labelled and described; at most, a door tells us what’s inside, not that it is a door or that we must open it to *see more*.

<!-- Eric: Can we link to what an affordance indicator is, for readers who may not be familiar with this term? -->

<!-- 
  Eric: 
  I don't think the door metaphor works as well as you think it might. 

  There's the immediate, where a door can be transparent or opaque, allowing us to see in or not. It can also be labeled or not, and that label can be accurate or not. Some doors can be opened by you, some open automatically for you, and sometimes other people open them for you. Additionally, doors are transition points from interiors to exteriors, rooms to rooms, etc. 

  There are also Norman Doors. If this piece is going where I think it might given the content you've provided, this might also be another metaphoric issue to contend with.

  In the larger scope of this piece, you also have just told me to think about bikes. Now you're telling me to think about doors. I'm not getting it without these comparisons being mapped to a more practical concept. 
-->

<!-- Eric: You're going to need to explain to me that communication via implication is. A technical example might help orient the reader and groudn this a little more. -->

Why do we struggle with implication when it comes to interfaces? Is it possible to be user-centred without pushing interaction triggers? And how can we better communicate how the interface works?

<!-- Eric: What is an interaction trigger? -->

## Explicit click fixation mashup
It’s easy to think the interface is about clicks, but no element has clicking as a functionality. And there is no aspect of any element that communicates clickability. Like pedalling, clicking is just a means, and neither a task nor a goal. The click doesn’t fill forms, take people through flows or provide sudden insight.

<!-- Manuel: I'm not sure if I understand that correctly, but <a> or <button> have clicking as a functionality. The cursor that changes when you hover a link communicates clickability. For both <a> and <button>, clicking is the task. -->

<!-- Eric: I'd suggest flipping the order of this sentence around. Clicking doesn't provide insight but it is the _mechanism_ that allows people to get what they actually want. -->

<!-- Eric: There's a sub-argument that I now wonder if you're building to or not now, and that's less clicks equals more effieciency. In this case, intentional friction can be helpful in certain contexts, so I'd be careful if that's the direction this piece is going. -->

Still, we attempt to express clickability and turn it into a feature by mixing various elements’ properties based on what we individually associate with clicking. Then, we create incoherence through coherency by applying it to all elements that fall under our understanding of being *clickable*.

<!-- Manuel: I don't understand that paragraph. An example might help. -->

<!-- Eric: When you say "attempt to express clickability and turn it into a feature" do you mean providing visual affordances to indicate the presence of interactivity? -->

### Let people think
The mantra about not making people think is not about reducing interfaces to a degree where all they have to do is mindless one-clicks. It’s about enabling people to understand the interface and related processes. By allowing them to read and think, they will also accumulate knowledge about how the web platform works, which makes other interfaces easier to use.

<!-- Eric: What are the related processes? -->

<!-- 
  Eric: 
  >By allowing them to read and think
  Read and think what? By being specific here you'll reduce ambiguity and confusion for the reader.
-->

<!-- 
  Eric:
  >accumulate knowledge about how the web platform works, which makes other interfaces easier to use
  Are you talking about external consistency?
-->

Trying to lower cognitive effort by pushing actions will backfire. Consider the link, the button and the select; their functionality, code and visuals are fundamentally different. When we make them as uniform as possible, hoping to increase clickability, we also lower usability, remove element meaning and replace people’s means of recognition and control.

<!-- Manuel: "Trying to lower cognitive effort by pushing actions will backfire." <- You're making very specific points, but I – and I'm sorry – have no idea what you're talking about. -->

<!-- Eric: What actions are getting pushed? And by whom? -->

In our quest against unnecessary cognitive effort, we must still allow people to think and gain experience to get the most out of the platform. We do that by communicating what things are.

<!-- 
  Eric:
  >our quest against unnecessary cognitive effort
  I think this may be the heart of what you're trying to communicate. If so, we'll want to revise the intro to state it as an assertation, and then use the following content to explain what, why, and how. 
-->

## Element before code
We start by using the elements’ inherent aspects, both what differentiates them and what makes them related. That means working with *correct* elements, which is slightly different from working with *valid* code.

<!-- Manuel: Do you really mean "slightly" or are using it as an exaggeration? Because correct and valid a completely different things.  -->

<!-- Eric: What elements? HTML elements? Precision will help here. -->

With valid code alone, we still leave room for making interfaces as clickable visuals. We can define elements by interaction triggers and do whatever we want because we compensate to meet accessibility criteria. High enough contrast and code that works with screen readers can be mistaken for good accessibility and usability. The reality of making visuals that don’t communicate element type is that no element code in the web platform can be the correct one; it doesn’t exist.

<!-- It seems like one of the points you're trying to communicate is: There's an inherent divergence between the semantic, markup-driven layer and then the CSS and JS visual layer. Reducing the gap between these two helps with understanding purpose, which in turn helps people get what they actually want. -->

With correct elements, we don’t have to compensate to get people through the interface or to make accessible solutions. We can work with all facets simultaneously, from semantic visuals to code in order to communicate functionality and roles. Then, we also get an idea about when and how it’s OK to make more custom solutions.

<!-- Eric: What would compensation look like here, in a specific technical way? -->

### Meaning of HTML
An element can communicate its role in four ways: implied, indirect relative implied, generic and explicit. The first three come from just using the element, and the fourth is set with a role attribute. While we will concentrate on code for the rest of this article, we could place visual properties into the same categories, ideally never having to separate it from code.

<!-- 
  Eric:
  >An element can communicate its role in four ways: implied, indirect relative implied, generic and explicit.
  I think working this into the piece earlier might be helpful for the reader. You can then unpack it later on as you get more detailed, to better reinforce your argument.
-->

The implied role is what elements have out of the box. They can also change indirectly depending on non-ARIA attributes and ancestor element types. Encoding intention through HTML happens via HTML Accessibility API Mappings (HTML-AAM). 

<!-- Manuel: "They can also change indirectly depending on non-ARIA attributes and ancestor element types." <- an example would be great here. -->

<!-- Eric: Can we link to that in the spec? -->

Elements that have no implied role are generic. That doesn’t mean the elements can be used anywhere; all HTML has designated usage areas and often visual semantics. But some don’t need a role or cannot have one because the usage wouldn’t work well with screen readers. For instance, `div`, `span` and `i` have the same generic role but different use cases and visual properties.

<!-- 
  Eric: 
  Can we:
  - Link to the generic role?
  - Link or show an example what you mean by visual semantics?

  Additionally, HTML as a language does not have visual semantics. Browsers apply that via their fallback stylesheets. That's why select on iOS looks different than one on Firefox.
-->

<!-- 
  Eric:
  >some don’t need a role or cannot have one
  To echo what Manuel menitoned prior, you can and should modify generic role elements with ARIA to instill meaning where appropriate. 
-->

When it comes to explicitly set roles, we cannot set the generic role, but we can set the role to *presentation* or *none*. The two are, in contrast to generic, not exposed in accessibility APIs or accessibility trees. Assistive tech cannot gather properties, such as layout, from presentation elements.  

<!-- Eric: I don't understand the inclusion of this paragraph. -->

We use the role attribute to communicate meaning HTML doesn’t have by default. It can be because the element is versatile, and it would be impractical to have a default role, or because we need to change an element’s default role to something else. Still, we cannot transform one element into another. The role and ARIA attributes intend to change the meaning of HTML but avoid doing so when semantics are strong or equal to the ARIA semantics it already implies.

<!-- 
  Eric: 
  I think you need to clarify more about what you mean about not being able to transform one element into another. ARIA functionally does this, save for situations like Forced Colors Mode. There is also the ability for JS to modify elements, which adjusts their intrincic semantics, and consequently, their roles. 

  Additionally, some elements are less meaningfull or completely meaningless outside the context of their required parent element—HTML is really poor about communicating this heiarchy with its taxonomy, which might be indirectly what you're getting at.
-->

### Examples of imperative and indirect ARIA roles

1. `header` and `footer` have the generic role. When we place them inside `article`, `aside`, `main`, `nav` or `section`, or elements that have set the role to article, complementary, main, navigation or region, `header` changes role to banner and `footer` gets the role of contentinfo.
```html
<!-- header and footer with the generic role -->
<body>
	<header></header>
	<main></main>
	<footer></footer>
</body>
<!-- header and footer with banner and contentinfo roles -->
<article>
	<header></header>
	<footer></footer>
</article>
```

<!-- Manuel: It's the exact opposite. It's banner and contentinfo in the context of the body, and generic when nested in the elements with the roles listed. -->

<!-- Eric: +1 -->

2. `section` has a generic role. When we give it an accessible name, typically using the aria-label attribute, it gets the role of region.
```html
<!-- section with the generic role -->
<section></section>
<!-- section with the region role -->
<section aria-label="changelog"></section>
```

<!-- Eric: There is also the sub-concern of the usability of named regions, and the their over-use. This seems outside the scope of this piece, but I always also try and advise caution here in that you don't want to overly-pollute your landmarks. -->

3. `img` with an empty alt attribute has the role of presentation. `img` with text inside the alt attribute has the role of img. `img` without the alt attribute has the role of img.
```html
<!-- img with the presentation role -->
<img alt="" src="/" />
<!-- img with the img role -->
<img alt="horse with beard" src="/" />
<img src="/" /> <!-- don’t do this -->
```

<!-- Manuel: "`img` without the alt attribute has the role of img" <- sounds positive. maybe add "but no accessible name"? -->

4. `select` has the role of combobox, but if we give it the multiple attribute or a size attribute greater than one, the role changes to listbox
```html
<!-- select with the combobox role -->
<select></select>
<!-- select with the listbox role -->
<select multiple></select>
<select size="3"></select>
<select multiple size="2"></select>
```

5. `strong` and `em` have the roles of strong and emphasis. Strong is for important, serious or urgent, while emphasis is for just that. Both are misused to a level where their code semantics are no longer useful; they are practically just a way to achieve bold and italic. Assistive tech ignores the code semantics, but some can read the styling if users activate those settings. Markdown and WYSIWYG editors also fail to differentiate here and output only `strong` and `em` by default, further contributing to the misuse.
```html
<!-- The author implies that something other than the movie is a better Elvis resource. -->
<i>Elvis</i> is the best <em>movie</em> about Elvis.
<!-- The author implies that other Elvis movies have other qualities. -->
<i>Elvis</i> is the <em>best</em> movie about Elvis.
```

<!-- Manuel: as a reader, I'd love to learn why you use <i> here. -->

<!-- Eric: Another thing here is screenreaders are only one mechanism that ingests semantic markup. Reader modes, RSS readers, text-to-speech, ML, etc. all ingest this and can use it as a reference point for communicating and inferring meaning. So, while it might be a moot point from a screen reader perspective, it still matters. -->

6. `small`, `u`, `i`, `b`, `q`, `pre` are some of the elements with generic role, just like `span`. We should still use them as intended and not interchangeably, as they have different default styling and sometimes behaviours.

7. `menu` has the role of list. It does not have the role of menu. It’s identical to `ul`; there is no inherent reason to use `menu` except if we want to separate the two in code. If we are concerned about indicating navigation, chances are we already have a `nav` element and aria-label. The possible confusion between HTML’s `menu` element and WAI-ARIA’s menu role is reason enough not to use the element. The menu role is less about navigation and more about choices and actions.

<!-- You've told me it has a role of list, but also should not be used as navigation. I know you know this is something you should not do, but it could be helpful to reinforce one of the points I think you're making to explain to the reader as to why this is not a good idea in the larger context of the argument you're making. -->

8. Many specific input types, such as color, date, file and password have no implicit ARIA role. Considering that inputs should have labels and often have attributes indicating the type, do they need a role as well?

<!-- Types are attributes, so it makes sense there is no implicit role based off this fact. While I feel the type attribute was a mistake in that each input type should have been its own discrete element, it's a parameter of the language we have to deal with since it'll be functionally impossible to change without breaking deep backwards compatability. ARIA's also does not have the grammar to allow for the convention of translating a type to something that could fit within its taxonomy, so it's also a bit of a moot point through this lens. -->

9. `label` has no role and cannot be given an aria-label attribute.

<!-- Eric: `label` is a weird once since it has a name that might suggest to a new practicioner of the language that it's used to label things, but in fact it has a highly specialized function and a small amount of limited pairings. I'm echoing an earlier comment here that explaining this in more detail might help your overall argument. -->

10. Setting `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` is prohibited on several elements such as `a` without the href attribute, `div`, `p`, `abbr`, `address`, `body`, `caption` and `code`. Elements that cannot have `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` can be given those if they change role, granted that they can change role.
```html
<!-- not allowed -->
<div aria-label="news"></div>
<a aria-label="crows">Crows</a>
<!-- allowed -->
<div role="article" aria-label="news"></div>
<a href="crows.png" aria-label="crows">Crow picture</a>
```

<!-- Eric: The language does not allow for it, but the browser is forgiving and certain forms of assistive technology have started to be more forgiving of just `aria-label` declared on a `div` because of its chronic misuse. How would that affect your argument? -->

11. `thead`, `tbody` and `tfoot` have the role of rowgroup though they are different elements and siblings. It reminds us that each one can have multiple rows.

<!-- Eric: Why does it remind us of that? -->

12. `dialog` has the role of dialog. It also has an implied `aria-modal` attribute set to true if it has been opened with the `showModal()` method. If we use `show()` method or the open attribute, `aria-modal` will be false, but the dialog role remains.

## Programming communication
ARIA roles have a huge caveat: Most assistive technology support neither roles nor certain elements’ implicit ARIA.

<!-- Manuel: Can we have an example? -->

What is the point then?

<!-- Manuel: The first sentence followed by that question make it sound like the support for ARIA is very poor in most AT, practically unusable. -->

First, we must hope better ARIA semantics support is coming. But also, when the goal is to create meaning, it’s best to work with elements that already have meaning. If we instead work with code, visuals, function and behaviour separately, we end up with mutated and rehashed elements. We remove and override semantics in favour of arbitrariness like branding and other expressions of misguided visual consistency that lower usability. And we find ourselves compensating by screaming at people to click.

<!-- Eric: It sounds like you're arguing for better undertanding of the three main pillars of the web platform, and how they all work together. I think that's a side concern to what your main agument is, and I'd encourage rephrasing it to better prop up your main point. Alternatively, socialize this concept earlier on, so it is less of a surprise as you're winding down for the conclusion. -->

Every HTML element is a compound of semantic properties contributing to helping people understand. Most meaning comes for free with the native web elements, leading to fewer lines of code. A minuscule increase in workload comes from concentrating on which elements to use.

<!-- Eric: I'm not sure if appeal to effort is useful here. You've communicated the value of selecting proper semantics should be self-evident, so an appeal to a trivial modtication of effort expended makes it seem like you're unsure that the argument is good enough on its own merits. If it is people should hypothetically feel that it is worth it. -->

Programming is communication work. Communication requires intent and meaning. Use the web platform to tell browsers how it should work for people. Tell people explicitly when browsers and other means of interaction fall short. Avoid scrambling for accessibility. That’s the implied web.

<!-- 
  Eric: 
  I love the first three sentences here, but the following three don't make a lot of sense to me in the larger context of the piece in its current state. You haven't really directed touched on what scrambling for accessibility is, or why it's bad, so I was surprised to read it.

  I also feel the term "the implied web" is a nice phrase, and may be helpful if you use it earlier to describe the highlighted shortcomings. For example, in thinking this through a little more I'm confused if the phrase, "the implied web" speaks to:

  1. Native HTML semantics being good because we don't need to add aria role declarations to everything, or
  2. The visual layer being the sole or leading source of meaning, which is implied by pixel configuration alone. -->

<!-- 
  Eric: 
  One last thing, and it's more for consideration than direct feedback to address: A lot of screen reader users I know actually disabled announcements for things like tabels, in the interest of speed and understanding in consuming web content. For understanding, the ability to use table-specific commands are enough of a signifier of meaning, and the lack of row and column information in the announement helps them carry the concept in their working memory. 

  The interesting bit here is that they can re-enable these announcements if they want to, but only if that semantic information was present in the first place. So, this is a case of a user benefitting from something coded with semantic precision, but diluting that in the aid of comprehension and getting what they want. This is agency, as allowed by developer and as exercised by user.
