intro: "<p>Learn why clean HTML code and accessibility aren't just good for your site but can also save you time and trouble with testing.</p>"
---
Semantic and accessible HTML serves as a powerful tool, enhancing not only human interaction but also the efficiency of software systems. For instance, when users fill out forms with clear labels and accessible input fields, this reduces errors and ensures sending accurate data to the backend and databases. You may also have heard about how a well structured web page is fundamental for search engine optimization (SEO). 
Creating crafts that are accessible and easy to use for everybody should be the top concern of every developer. The good thing is that prioritizing this aspect can also have a positive side effect: it enables seamless interactions between your website and other software components.
Let's explore in particular how to improve your testing processes and save valuable time.

<!-- Manuel: 
1. "enhancing not only human interaction but also the efficiency of software systems" <- can we get some examples, please?
2. "equally vital" <- Important? yes! Equal with general access to users? I don't knowâ€¦
3. "often-overlooked" <- examples?
 -->

 <!-- Saptak: I agree with Manuel, I also feel making things easier for people is more important than seamless interactions between software parts. Though seamless interaction is related to better usability for people hence it is very important to test that, but I think the phrasing of the sentence makes it feel like end-user usability is undermined a little. -->

 <!-- Stefania: Thanks for this input, I tried to add examples and rephrase the problematic part -->

## The Connection Between Semantic HTML, Accessibility, and Testing

This topic was beautifully explored by Rita Castro, in her talk [a11y and TDD: A Perfect Match](https://portal.gitnation.org/contents/a11y-and-tdd-a-perfect-match). While Rita mainly focuses on unit tests, it's worth mentioning how these principles can be applied to end-to-end testing as well, and for the same reasons.

## The End-to-End Testing Dilemma

End-to-end testing, goes beyond checking individual parts of a website. It tries to act like a real user in a real web browser, testing the whole webpage as it would appear to someone using it for real.

Let's imagine we are writing a unit test for a list item component, that produces the following HTML:

```html
<li>
  A description for this item
  <button type="button">Pick this item</button>
</li>
```

And the unit test can target the button like this:

```js
screen.getByRole('button')
```

This approach is great for testing the component in isolation, which is what "unit" means. It simplifies testing by not worrying about other possible buttons on the page and by ignoring context.

However, unit tests can't fully replicate real-life scenarios. For instance, they can't ensure that clicking the button saves some data for the current user and navigates to another page.

Now, consider our list item used in a full web page, with a topbar that contains buttons and other sections beyond the list container. The list in the page wasn't built with semantics and accessibility in mind, so it looks like this (taken from real production web application page):

```html
<body>
  <div id="root">
    <div>
      <div>
        <div>
          <div>
            <div>
              <!-- topbar -->
            </div>
            <div>
              <div>
                <header>
                  <div>
                    <h1>Page Title</h1>
                    <h3>Page subtitle</h3>
                  </div>
                </header>
                <div>
                  <!-- a form for filtering the list -->
                  <hr />
                  <div>
                    <div>
                      <div>
                        <div>
                          <div>
                            <p>A description for this item</p>
                          </div>
                        </div>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                        <button>
                          <span> Pick this item </span>
                        </button>
                      </div>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      <div>
                        <!-- second item -->
                      </div>
                      <!-- ... -->
                    </div>
                  </div>
                </div>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</body>
```

<!-- Manuel: There's a header, an h1, a p, a button. Looks pretty smenativ to me. At least I've seen worse. -->
<!-- Stefania: True. Replaced with: "The list in the page wasn't built with semantics and accessibility in mind" -->

Most end-to-end testing tools can record your actions as you interact with a webpage and then use those actions for automation. They save selectors automatically to identify the items you interact with.
We want to test the click of the button in the first element in the list. I have to confess I simplified a bit the HTML in the example, and the real selector produced by the tool looks like this:

```html
//*[@id="root"]/div/div/div/div/div/div/div[3]/div/div/div[2]/div[1]/div[2]/button
```

Whenever you tweak your HTML, even adding or removing only one of the div wrappers, your test suite can easily get messed up in this situation. End-to-end tests aren't something you update every day because they are slow and need lots of resources. So, figuring out why a test failed can be time-consuming and take you away from more important tasks.

Testing tools are getting more and more better at identifing targets, but the algorithms are not bulletproof and can't react to page structure changes with 100% reliability. That's why it is important that targets can be recognized without ambiguity. One of the techniques more common to obtain this clarity is adding unique `id`s, `test-id`s or other selectors to the HTML elements, but it's not a best practice, for a bunch of reasons:

* **Separation of Concerns**: Mixing testing concerns with your application's business logic violates the principle of separation of concerns. You are coupling two distinct and indipendent objects and a person working in one of the sides may be totally unaware that something is used and necessary on the other side. This person can also be the same person that didn't work on one of the parts for some time and lose the context in the meanwhile.
* **Maintainability**: Test IDs may need to change or evolve as your application grows and changes. When you embed these IDs directly in your code, you may need to make widespread changes throughout your codebase whenever test requirements change. This can be time-consuming and error-prone.
* **Code Clutter**: Embedding test-related identifiers in your source code can clutter the codebase and make it less readable for developers.
* **Accessibility**: Adding test IDs actively misses the opportunity to incorporate accessibility testing for free. If my test suite explicitly looks for a button, it also ensures that the target keeps being an accessible button, and it's not refactored to unsemantic div later.

<!-- Manuel: "your test suite can easily get messed up" <- Instead of saying "use less divs", shouldn't testing tools get better at locating items on the page?-->
<!-- Stefania: You're right, the problem here wasn't having too many divs, but rather having an unsemantic list, hope I clarified that -->

<!-- Saptak: As far as my experience with end-to-end testing, I usually write the selectors myself (which I don't know is the best practise or not). I always use class/ids in the elements and then query using them while trying to find an element on the page with it's xpath? I am not sure how writing semantic HTML will help with this automatic selectors. Won't tweaking the HTML even with semantic HTML mess up the test suite? -->

<!-- Stefania: hope I explained the first part above.
"I am not sure how writing semantic HTML will help with this automatic selectors." -> agree, it probably want, I wanted to suggest to switch to manual selector instead, I'm adding this clarification.
"Won't tweaking the HTML even with semantic HTML mess up the test suite?" -> sure thing, but you were supposed to have semantic HTML in first place, and adjusting the HTML is bug fixing and your test are supposed to adapt only this time and ensure the HTML stays semantic later.
 -->

## The Power of Semantic HTML in Testing

Now, envision a different scenario where your list is built with clean, semantic HTML. We don't use the automatic targeting algorithm and we add a manual selector for the first item in the list like this:

```html
//*li[1]/button
```

<!-- Manuel: 
1. In the previous example you used a different syntax. This one looks like CSS.
2. That example looks unrealistic. At least, some of the divs must have been there for a reason. Also, the presence of a lot of divs doesn't mean that your code isn't clean and semantic. You can have both, semantic HTML and a lot of divs. -->

<!-- Stefania:
1. fixed, using same semantic
2. unfortunately it's something that happened to me and it's a page that we have in production. In particular I needed to deploy a change across several places, and for this reason, in this place only, I got blocked for about a week. Big part of all of this makes sense only for situations similar to what we have in my company or bigger companies, with >80 engineers and also separated QA people and therefore lot of complexity. Of course for a simple web page doesn't make any sense to have e2e tests at all. The point here is that having a selector similar to this //*[@id="root"]/div/div/div/div/div/div/div[3]/div/div/div[2]/div[1]/div[2]/button is very fragile, and better to use manual target instead. But the latter would be easy and possible only with good page structure and semantic HTML.
-->

Regardless of any HTML changes you make to the sourrounding structure around the list item, your test remains rock-solid. To recap:
* Relying on automatic targeting algorithm may result in flakyness and, in best case scenario, you need to regenerate the target. If your tests require adjstements every time you change the underlying structure of your markup, they may not authentically simulate a user journey but instead are too closely tied to implementation details.
* Using arbitrary `ids` or other unique selectors is a bad practice.
* Having semantic HTML enables easy manual targeting that is more resilient against changes. It should also help detecting actions that may break the accessibility of your UI.

<!-- Manuel: Not regardless of _any_ HTML. If I wrap the button in an element, the test won't work anymore, right? -->
<!-- Stefania: rephrased -->

<!-- Saptak: I am little confused with the code example since there is a mix of HTML, CSS and some end-to-end testing code. For example, in this section, I have no idea what is the HTML structure, and how that is helping me write end-to-end testing. I feel some better example with the semantic HTML structure as well as an example testing code will help with solidifying the point you are trying to make. Like can you give an example of the selector automatically generated with end-to-end testing tool for a page with more semantic HTMLs and how that is better than the previous selector in being more reliable? -->
<!-- Stefania: I tried to explain that further in the bulletpoint recap above -->

## Why It Matters

So, why should you care about semantic HTML and accessibility in testing?

<!-- Manuel: I still haven't figured out what accessibility does for testing? I kinda understand what you mean by semantic here, but which part does accessibility play? -->
<!-- Stefania: hope this is more clear now -->

* **Developer and QA Bliss**: Life becomes easier for developers and QA engineers. Writing tests becomes a breeze when you can work with straightforward, semantic code.
* **Mimicking Real Users**: Your tests better mimic real user behavior. Real users don't look for divs and spans in your web application; they look for headings, buttons, links, and familiar interface elements with clear labels.
<!-- Manuel: Users aren't concerned with complex div hierarchies, but they aren't conserned with h2s, h3s, <button>, <a>, or any HTML either. -->
<!-- Stefania: What I mean is that a user may know zero about HTML, but they know what a button, a link or a text input field is, and they know how they can usually interact with them and what to expect. I think screen readers users are also well aware of what haading level 1 or 2 are -->
* **Reliability and Time Savings**: Your tests become more reliable and won't break with every deployment for arbitrary reasons. Say goodbye to countless hours spent tweaking tests and hello to more productive work.
<!-- Manuel: I don't know anything about testing, but again, that sounds like the testing tool is shit if a minor change to the structure breaks everything. -->
<!-- Stefania: Think about how hard we find producing accessible interface and how inaccessible is the web, why is that? Assistive technologies users have another layer of software between them and your interface. Interacting with machines is way harder than interacting with humans and that's why AI is so limited as well. Humans can fill the gaps when facing missing information because we are so good at pattern recognition and we are clever, machines are not, they are very stupid and they need very clear instructions. so also for this reason there is a strong relationship between testing and a11y, they partially suffer from the same issues and e2e testing in particular, because it's supposed to simulate real user behavior, but it's a very limited simulation. so yes, it's real shit :D -->

In conclusion, embracing semantic HTML and accessibility in your development process isn't just about adhering to best practices; it's a game-changer for testing. It streamlines your testing efforts, makes your tests more realistic, and ensures they stand the test of timeâ€”saving you precious hours and frustration. So, don't underestimate the power of clean code; it could be your testing superhero in disguise.
