<!-- Eric: My comments echo Manuel's. Beyond that, this is a great piece about a par of HTML I wish more people knew about. Thank you for writing it. -->

Consider a scenario where you have a login form containing two input fields with corresponding labels, alongside a submit and a reset button. If you submit the form, the action of the form gets triggered, and you can work with the `formData`.

The layout looks nice as well (let’s imagine we have added some fancy CSS).

```html
<form action="/login" method="get">
  <div>
    <label for="username">Username</label>
    <input type="text" name="username" id="username" required />
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <label for="password">Password</label>
    <input type="password" name="password" id="password" required />
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <button type="reset">Reset</button>
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </div>
</form>
```

## The Challenge
Now, let's delve into a new requirement presented by your client. They want a revamped layout with the buttons placed elsewhere. This redesign, however, leads to a problem.
The buttons are no longer within the form element which causes the buttons to lose their association to the form.

```html
<main>
  <form action="/login" method="get">
    <div>
      <label for="username">Username</label>
      <input type="text" name="username" id="username" required />
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <label for="password">Password</label>
      <input type="password" name="password" id="password" required />
    </div>
  </form>
  
  <!-- Because of the new layout, we have to move the buttons 
  outside of the form -->
  <div>
      <button type="reset">Reset</button>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </div>
</main>
```

If you try to submit or reset the form, nothing will happen.

These buttons must be within the form element to be functionally associated with it.
Unfortunately, the client insists on the new layout and to move the buttons outside the form element is the only option you have.

## The Solution
If you read the [button element’s specification](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button?retiredLocale=de#form), there is an interesting attribute called `form`. This is very helpful in your situation and will solve your problem. You can add the `form` attribute to each button and assign a name to it. The name can be whatever you want. A good name would be _form-login_.
With that change, you just have to add an `id` attribute to the form element itself. The value of the attribute has to be the same as in the `form` attribute. That's it!  

<!-- Manuel: 
1. "element’s specification" <-- link please
2. Just a general stylistic comment: The first two sentece are fillers, they don't add any value. They can be reduced to "The form attribute can help with that. We can add it..."
3. "We can add the" <- You mix forms of address. Please choose one form, adress the reader either with "you" or "we". -->

<!--
Alex:
1. Added Link
2. Please change it if you want to. I would leave it as it is because I do like those fillers.
3. I have changed the document to the "you"-form.
-->

```html
<main>
  <form action="/login" method="get" id="form-login">
    <div>
      <label for="username">Username</label>
      <input type="text" name="username" id="username" required />
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <label for="password">Password</label>
      <input type="password" name="password" id="password" required />
    </div>
  </form>
  
  <!-- Because of the new layout, we have to move the Buttons outside the form -->
  <div>
      <button type="reset" form="form-login">Reset</button>
      <button type="submit" form="form-login">Submit</button>
  </div>
</main>
```

With these adjustments, your form works like before but with the freedom of positioning your buttons as you want.

<!-- Manuel: "Unfortunately, this step alone is not enough." <- that makes it sound like you have to do a lot of extra work, but it's just an id you have to add. 
Please combine the instructions for adding the attributes and the id one step and remove the second code sample. -->
<!-- Alex: I have combined them -->

## A Word on Practicality
The same approach can be applied to the `input`, `textarea`, `select` and other `form` elements as well. You can check the MDN documentation to see if an element accepts this attribute. 
With that approach elements are no longer required to be children of the form element. You are able to place your elements as you wish in the DOM, and they are always associated with the `form` element.

<!-- Manuel: 
1. what about textarea, select, etc.? It probably works with all form elements, right? please rewrite it.
2. "With that approach you are free to spread the **form** children's even more" <- what does that mean?-->

<!-- Alex:
1. I added those examples and made it more generic and referenced to MDN docs.
2. I wrote it differently.
-->

## Accessibility concerns
With this approach you will get a lot of freedom with your layout, however, it is important to not mess up the layout too much and place the elements in an order that still makes sense to the user. Otherwise, it can be confusing and frustrating.

For example, imagine you have a `form` where users need to enter their name and email address. If you use the `form` attribute to place the `input` elements for the name and email address anywhere in the DOM, a visually impaired user may have difficulty finding the two elements and understanding how they are related.

<!-- Manuel: You're addressing a11y issues, but the potential negative impact on the user doesn't really come out. Can you elaborate a bit more on that? -->
<!-- Alex: I added an example. I hope this makes it more clear. -->

## Browser compatibility
The `form` attribute is well-supported, with Internet Explorer being an exception.
For detailed browser compatibility information, refer to [caniuse](https://caniuse.com/form-attribute).

<!-- Manuel: Please consider removing the sentence "Because Microsoft…". I have clients that still have to support IE < 10. -->
<!-- Alex: I deleted it. -->

## Conclusion
With the `form` attribute you are no longer restricted to position your inputs and buttons inside the `form` element boundaries. This approach enriches the potential for more flexibility and creative form designs.
