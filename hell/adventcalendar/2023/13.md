ARIA stands for Accessible Rich Internet Applications. It is a set of roles and attributes that makes web page elements accessible to users who require assistive technology, like screen readers, when native HTML alone is not enough. One of these sets of roles and attributes is aimed at defining live regions.

<!-- Manuel: link to the ARIA spec, please -->

A live region is an area that is dynamically updated on a web page, using JavaScript, and does not receive focus when the update happens.

<!-- Manuel: That sentence doesn't explain what a live region does. The important bit is that changes to the live region trigger screen readers to announce the content in the live region. -->

Live regions are commonly used for different types of notification like form errors, loading spinners, search results that appear on dynamic search, and toasts.

A practical example, on an e-commerce website, is a notification like “product added to cart” that displays momentarily, somewhere on the page, whenever the “add to cart” button is pressed. While sighted users would easily see it, screen reader users would not know that the page had been updated. Adding a live region to the parent element that displays this type of notification allows it to be announced by screen readers.

<!-- 
  Eric:
  >While sighted users would easily see it
  Minor nit, but let's remove "easily". Folks with low vision/use screen magnification often miss them.
-->

<!--

  Too many commas. Either split it into two sentences, or rephrase it so there are less comma splices.
-->

## Creating Live Regions

There are two ways widely used to implement a live region in an HTML element: adding the `aria-live` attribute or adding a live region role. A third option is to use the HTML `<output>` element.

<!-- 
  Eric: 
  >adding a live region role.
  Do you mean adding a role that has an implicit live region?
-->

<!-- Eric: I'm not sure I'd use `output` as a method here. Its support is too inconsistent to be reliable. -->
<!-- Manuel: I'd keep it but mention that there are quircks. You could link to Scotts post: https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2019/07/10/the-output-element.html -->

### `aria-live` Attribute

The `aria-live` attribute on an HTML element creates the behaviour of a live region. It indicates when dynamic updates should be announced to users of assistive technology. This attribute has three possible values:

<!-- 
  Eric: 
  >The `aria-live` attribute on an HTML element creates the behaviour of a live region.
  How? Does it have to be declared? 
-->

* `off` -> This is the default value. No changes will be announced, unless if the user is focused on the region where the update happens.

<!-- Eric: Let's use colons (:) instead of arrows (->). Much nicer screen reader experience. -->

* `polite` -> The screen reader will announce the changes when it has a chance. It may be, for example, after reading the current sentence. This option should be used for low priority updates that don’t require immediate attention from the user.

<!-- Eric: Which current sentence? -->

* `assertive` -> The screen reader will interrupt whatever it is reading to announce the content update. This option should only be used for time-sensitive, critical information.

Going back to the e-commerce website example, the “product added to cart” message may have an `aria-live=“polite”` attribute. 

<!-- Eric: Great callout. I've run into so many people who thing everything should be assertive because "it's important" -->

```html
<div aria-live="polite">
	<p>Product added to cart.</p>
<div>
```

However, if the user is filling out a payment information form and a field is missing, this notification has a higher degree of priority and may have an `aria-live="assertive"`.

<!-- Eric: I don't agree with this. A better example might be something time-sensitive, such as a weather alert or an emergency broadcast. -->
<!-- Manuel: +1 -->

Please note that those are generic examples. The `aria-live` attribute value will depend on different factors. One important aspect to keep in mind is that the `assertive` level is disruptive for screen reader users and should only be used when absolutely required. 

<!-- Eric: I might suggest mentioning the best way to figure out if something should be an assertive announcement is to ask the people who will be the recipient of the message. -->

There are other aria attributes that, in theory, should provide greater control of how aria live regions should behave. But, in practice, they have poor support.

<!-- Eric: I noticed that you used "ARIA" at the start of this post, and then shifted over to using "aria". I might suggest updating those instances to use "ARIA" when not code-formatted to be consistent and also honor its acronym treatment. -->
<!-- Manuel: "But, in practice, they have poor support" <-- all of them? Can you link to tests, a blog post or a11ysupport.io? -->

* `aria-atomic` -> specifies if the whole live region should be announced (`true`) or only the content that has changed (`false`)

<!-- We use a companion declaration of `aria-atomic="true"` for our component work for niche support reasons. Might be helpful to mention if the user is going to be building a robust messaging system. -->

* `aria-busy` -> indicates that the element is not yet ready to be announced because it’s being modified. The default value is `false`, but, even when defined as `true`, it means that screen readers *may* wait to announce the changes.

* `aria-relevant` -> specifies which updates are relevant to be announced. Multiple space-separated values can be used: `additions`, `removals`, and `text`. Or the shorthand `all`. 

<!-- Eric: I think I'd like some detail on anticipated use cases for these. -->

### Live Region Roles

[W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#live_region_roles) lists five live region roles, according to the type of notification that they announce:

* `alert` -> Time-sensitive notifications that require immediate attention, like form errors.

<!-- Manuel: Please use colons (:) instead of arrows (->) here as well -->

* `status` -> Notifications that are not as important as an `alert`, nor time-sensitive.

* `log` -> The order in which the notifications are added have meaning, as in a log, and old information may disappear.

* `marquee` -> The information is non-essential, changes often, and the order is not meaningful.

* `timer` -> The notification is the amount of elapsed time from a starting point or the remaining time until an end point of a numerical counter.

Each live region role has an implicit `aria-live` attribute:

* `role="alert"` has `aria-live="assertive"`

* `role="status"` has `aria-live="polite"`

* `role="log"` has `aria-live="polite"`

* `role="marquee"` has `aria-live="off"`

* `role="timer"` has `aria-live="off"`

[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions#roles_with_implicit_live_region_attributes) recommends adding a redundant `aria-live` attribute to the alert, status, and log roles to maximize compatibility.

<div class="highlight">

Please keep in mind that, in practice, only two of these live region roles are widely used and have good browser/screen reader support: alert and status.

</div>

<!-- 
  Eric: 
  >Please keep in mind that, in practice, only two of these live region roles are widely used and have good browser/screen reader support: alert and status.
  You've buried the lede here. I might suggest a slight rephrase:
  Please keep in mind that `role="status"` and `role="alert"` are the only two live region roles that have good browser/screen reader support.
-->

### `aria-live` Attribute vs Live Region Role

So, what is the difference between using `aria-live` and a live region role? `aria-live` is an attribute that creates the behaviour of a live region by defining the “politeness” level of how the notification should be announced.

A live region role not only creates the behaviour of a live region, but also provides semantic meaning to screen readers. It has an implicit `aria-live` attribute.

<!-- Manuel: it has an implicit aria-live property, not attribute -->

For example, a notification in a `role="alert"` element has an implicit `aria-live="assertive"` attribute and informs the screen reader that the information in that area is really an alert. While the `aria-live="assertive"` attribute by itself will inform the screen reader that it should interrupt whatever is it reading to announce that notification.

<!-- Eric: Ah, this section is great! Can we try threading it up higher in the post so the flow is more like: 1. aria-live and live region roles exist, 2. What is the difference between them, and then 3. What are they? Something along those lines. -->
<!-- Manuel:
1. Again implicit property, no attribute.
2. the notfication doesn't have an implicit attribute, but the element itself 
3. "informs the screen reader that the information in that area" <- have you tested that? It does in NVDA/FF, but not with VO/macos or Talkback/Chrome, for exmaple
4. Another difference is that role=alert also set aria-atomic=true. you can test it here: https://codepen.io/matuzo/pen/BaMLXWP?editors=1010
-->

### HTML `<output>`

The native HTML `<output>` element works as a live region, even though it is not as commonly used as the options described above. According to [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/output), `<output>` can be used to “inject the results of a calculation or the outcome of a user action”. This element has the implicit `aria-role="status"`. [Scott O’Hara](https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2019/07/10/the-output-element.html) wrote a detailed article about this HTML element.

<!--Eric: From a previous comment, we might also want some language here about how this is mostly an academic curiosity, and should not be used in production. See: https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2019/07/10/the-output-element.html#quirks-with-the-output-element -->

<!-- Manuel: You mean role=status, not aria-role=status, right? -->

## Taking Control

Screen readers allow users to control how they navigate a web page. For example, they can go first through all the headings of a page before deciding to read a full section. They can also go back and read a specific content again.

But when an element has a live region, the control is taken away from the screen reader user. They will be forced to hear the notification, either in a *polite* or *assertive* way, and that announcement only happens once. 

Therefore, developers should use caution when implementing live regions. They can negatively impact a screen reader user experience if poorly implemented or if there are too many of them, providing non-stop notifications. It is better not to have any aria-live region than to have poorly implemented ones.

<!-- 
   Eric: 
   >It is better not to have any aria-live region than to have poorly implemented ones.
   I love this entire section, but might suggest rephrasing this. Lack of a live region announcement can lead to WCAG failures, so instead of saying not to use them can we instead advocate for testing them with assistive technology to ensure they're working as intended?
 -->

## “Robust” live regions

Unfortunately, live regions don’t behave consistently in all browser/screen reader combinations, even if all roles and attributes are added according to the specification. However, there are a few recommendations that can be followed to make the implementation as robust as possible:

1. The element that contains the aria-live attribute or live region role should be in the DOM, empty, before the update happens. Ideally, on page load or as close as possible to it. This is important because the element needs to be in the accessibility tree in order to be announced.

<!-- Eric: I might suggest turning "1.", "2.", "3." into subheadings ("### First: Insert the live region", "### Second: Add dynamic content", etc.) -->

<!-- Eric: Can we link to what the accessibility tree is? It's not something commonly known by most devs. -->

For example, the `div` below can be part of the initial HTML markup and, later on, used for a dynamic notification:

```html
<div role="status"><div>
```

The live region role informs the screen reader that it needs to keep track of what happens in that area. If the element is dynamically injected in the DOM at the same time as the notification happens, it may not be correctly announced.

<!-- Eric: It might also be work explicitly stating that the inclusion of this declaration in the DOM won't fire a live region announcement. -->

The same will happen if the element is in the HTML, but has the CSS property `display: none`. Although this property can be dynamically changed with JavaScript, the element will not be in the accessibility tree. The dynamic update to `display: block` cannot be done at the same time as the content update.

<!-- 
  Eric:
  >the element will not be in the accessibility tree
  Which element and why? Let's be as explict as possible here.
-->

<!--
  Eric:
  >The dynamic update to `display: block` cannot be done at the same time as the content update.
  I'd suggest providing more detail here, and doing so as a new paragraph.
-->

A live region with `role="alert"` may be announced if injected in the DOM when the notification happens, but it probably won’t with role="status".

<!-- Manuel: yeah? is that based on your research or did you read that somewhere? -->

2. The dynamic content should be added to descendants of the element that has the `aria-live` attribute or live role region. Adding to the previous example, the dynamic content can be added as: 

```html
<div role="status">
	<p>Product added to cart.</p>
<div>
```

3. Aria live regions should only be used for content that is added or modified dynamically and on elements that do not require user interaction, nor receive focus when the update happens.

<!-- Manuel: I'm not sure what exactly "aria live regions should only be used for content that is added or modified dynamically" means -->

Besides the above recommendations, there are a few tips that can improve the user experience:

* Live regions should be concise. Remember that screen reader users have no control over it. And since the notification is only announced once, there’s no possibility to go back and review it.

<!-- Eric: Any considerations for punctuation? -->

<!-- Manuel: I'm not a screen reader pro, but aren't there shorcuts that allow you to repeat the last announcement? -->

* The notification should be clear. Even if the text has headings, bold content or any other semantic HTML, screen readers will read the copy as plain text.

<!-- Eric: I think we need a more precise word than "clear". We should also explicitly mention that interactive content like links and buttons aren't announced as interactive if inserted. -->

* Don’t use special characters.

<!-- Eric: Such as? Special characters can mean different things to different folks. -->

* If the live region contains a notification specific for screen reader users that does not appear visually, it is recommended to remove it shortly after it shows up. This is important to avoid screen readers announcing old updates that are not relevant anymore. According to [Sarah Higley](https://www.youtube.com/live/W5YAaLLBKhQ?si=SxKUbgEKmGxItV8D), a notification doesn’t need to stay long in the DOM. Even half a second is enough because the screen reader is watching the live regions for updates, so it will announce any new content, even if it’s removed right after.

<!-- Eric: There's some nuance here. Live region content is discoverable if a screen reader is exploring the DOM by navigating the page, and that can be both good and bad. Most use cases like toasts we want to remove it, but we don't necessarily want to remove it when communicating user-facing state and status that other ARIA cannot. -->

* Don’t add too many live regions to the same page. It may slow down the screen reader performance, as well as cause conflicts if more than one fires at the same time.

<!-- Eric: Formatting nit: We'll want to not have empty lines between each bullet point to ensure it's rendered as a single unordered list. -->
<!-- Manuel: "It may slow down the screen reader performance" <- what exactly is it that could slow down performance? -->

Keep in mind that if a live region can be avoided, take that route. Whenever possible, move focus and don’t add a live region. However, focus should only move if it’s because of a user action. Also, depending on the scenario, adding clear instructions may be enough, instead of using a live region.

<!-- Eric: Great thought here. Can we move it higher up in the piece so the flow is something along the lines of: 1. What are live regions? 2. When are they useful? 3. When should you not use them? 4. Implementation particulars. -->

<!-- Manuel:  "Whenever possible, move focus and don’t add a live region" <- Hmm...I disagree. Thinking of a complex filter form, you don't want to move focus everytime the user changes a value, but you still want to give them feedback. -->

## Testing

It is crucial to test live regions with different browser/screen reader combinations. And, whenever possible, get your page tested by a real screen reader user. 

If you need help to get started with screen readers, Sara Soueidan has an article with detailed instructions on [setting up a screen reader testing environment on your computer](https://www.sarasoueidan.com/blog/testing-environment-setup/).

Make sure to perform your tests with compatible browser/screen reader combinations. According to [Deque](https://dequeuniversity.com/screenreaders/forms-guide#desktop-forms-guide-recommended), the best pairings for desktop compatibility are:

* JAWS on Chrome, Edge, and Firefox
* NVDA on Firefox, Chrome, and Edge
* Narrator on Edge
* VoiceOver on Safari

Most likely, you won’t be able to test your live region implementation with all the above combinations. So, how to choose which ones to test? Use the latest [WebAIM’s Screen Reader User Survey](https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey9/) to narrow downs the pairings.

<!-- Manuel: Why? I have a Mac and a virtual machine. I can test all of them. Also, narrowing down is not a solution. If you don't have access to an iPhone, you need one. -->

The results show that the most popular screen readers are JAWS, NVDA, and VoiceOver. The first two are for Windows and the last one for macOS.

[Sara Soueidean](https://www.sarasoueidan.com/blog/testing-environment-setup/#which-browser-and-screen-reader-pairings-should-you-test-on?) suggests the following pairings for testing based on usage and compatibility:

* JAWS on Chrome
* NVDA on Firefox
* Narrator on Edge
* VoiceOver on Safari for macOS,

It’s also important to test live regions on mobile devices using the native screen readers on each device:

* VoiceOver on Safari for iOS and iPadOS
* Talkback on Chrome for Android devices

<!-- Manuel: We don't need both recommendations. They're basically the same. Remove one, please.-->

You will probably notice that the same implementation will not behave the same way across the board.

<!-- Eric: Why? -->
<!-- Manuel: What are the differences and why should we care about them? -->

## When not to use a live region

Although a live region may seem like the ideal solution to announce a dynamic content update, it is not always the best approach. Here are a few examples when it’s better not to use it:

* If the element needs a live region, but it’s a UI pattern in which it is not behaving as expected, consider replacing it by clear static instructions. It may be a better experience for screen reader users to read additional instructions, or even a help page, than to have an aria live region that doesn’t work properly.
* Focus change and live regions firing at the same time are prone to conflicts. If there is a focus change, make it clear to the user what is the new context and remove the aria live region.
* Don’t use live regions to announce state changes that can be communicated through an aria state. For example, if using an accordion, use the attribute aria-expanded to indicate if it’s opened or closed. If using a toggle button, use aria-pressed.
* Don’t use live regions for visual UIs that change constantly. [Sarah Higley](https://www.youtube.com/live/W5YAaLLBKhQ?si=SxKUbgEKmGxItV8D) suggests to provide a separate interface in some scenarios. This will keep the live region concise by announcing only relevant information. A practical example would be a search box in which the results update every time the user types a character. Wrapping the element in an aria live region would be too verbose because every single change would be announced.

<!-- Manuel:
1. "a UI pattern in which it is not behaving as expected," <- example?
2. "an aria live region that doesn’t work properly" <- after reading your article I have the feeling that using live regions is a bad idea because they're buggy and broken.
3. "remove the aria live region" <- remove the entire region? What if you need it somewhere else? -->

## Wrapping up

It’s preferable not to use live regions, but, if your page requires it, follow the specification to implement it in the most robust way possible. Don’t add too many live regions to the same page and only make them `assertive` if it’s absolutely necessary. And don’t forget to test your live regions thoroughly and re-test often to confirm that they still work as intended.
