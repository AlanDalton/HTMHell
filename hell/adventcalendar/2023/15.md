<!-- Manuel: Thanks a lot. I really enjoyed your post and I like your approach. Although I can see that there will be people who won't agree with you, I found the underlying message very inspiring! -->

<!-- Eric: Big fan of your work, Vasilis. This was a pleasure to review. -->

Recently when I gave a coding assignment — an art directed web page about a font — a student asked: does it have to be *semantic and shit?* The whole class looked up, curious about the answer — *please let it be no!* I answered that no, it doesn’t have to be semantic and shit, but it does have to be well designed and the user experience should be well considered. Relieved, all of my students agreed. They do care about a good user experience.

The joke here is, of course, that a well considered user experience starts with well considered <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>.

<!-- Eric: Can we remove the `title` attribute and go with the "HyperText Markup Language (<abbr>HTML</abbr>)" pattern instead? -->

Somehow my students are allergic to semantics and shit. And they’re not alone. If you look at 99% of all websites in the wild, everybody who worked on them seems to be allergic to semantics and shit. On most websites heading levels are just random numbers, loosely based on font-size. Form fields have no labels. Links and buttons are divs. It’s really pretty bad. So it’s not just my students, the whole industry doesn’t understand semantics and shit.

<!-- Manuel: "If you look at 99% of all websites in the wild, everybody who worked on them seems to be allergic to semantics and shit." <- people won't like that sentence but it works for me because it's obvious that it's there to underline the bad situation in quality of websites in general. also, you're linking the webaim 1 million report several times, where the number of erroneous site is close to 99. -->

Recently I decided to stop using the word *semantics*. Instead I talk about the <abbr title="User eXperience">UX</abbr> of <abbr>HTML</abbr>. And all of a sudden my students are not allergic to <abbr>HTML</abbr> anymore but really interested. Instead of explaining the meaning of a certain element, I show them *what it does*. So we look at *what happens* when you add a label to an input: The input and the label now form a pair. You can now click on the label to interact with a checkbox. The label will be read out loud when you focus on an input with a screenreader. When you hover over a *label,* the hover state of the connected *input* is shown. My students *love* stuff like that. They care about <abbr>UX</abbr>. 

I show them that <span onclick="window.location.href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/span'" style="text-decoration: underline">a span with an onclick-event</span> might seem to be behaving like a link, but that there are many layers of <abbr>UX</abbr> missing when you look a bit closer: right-click on <span onclick="window.location.href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/span'" style="text-decoration: underline">the span</span>, and a generic context menu opens up. When on the other hand you right-click on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a">a proper link</a> a specialised context menu opens, with all kinds of options that are specific to a link. And I show them that proper links show up when you ask your screen reader to list all the links on a page, yet divs with an onclick-event don’t. Moreover, a div doesn’t receive focus when you tab to it. And so on. My students see this and they get it. And they love the fact that by being lazy they get much more result.

So when I teach about <abbr>HTML</abbr> I always start with the elements that are obviously interactive. I show them the multitude of <abbr>UX</abbr> layers of a link, I show them the layers and layers of <abbr>UX</abbr> that are added to a well considered form. I show them what happens on a phone when you use an input with a default text type instead of the proper type of email. They *get* this, and they want to know more. So I show them more. I show them the `required` attribute which makes it possible to validate not only form fields, but also fieldsets and forms. They *love* this stuff. 

Then I go on and show the `details` element with a `summary`. Whoah! No JavaScript! 

<!-- 
  Eric: Curious, and not sure if this is an actionable comment: What about the nitty-gritty of details/summary screen reader support of details/summary through the lens of the UX of HTML? Roughly speaking, there's this path of awareness:

  1. I learned that HTML exists.
  2. I learned how HTML is written.
  3. I learned that HTML elements have user-facing benefits when applied properly.
  4. I learned that HTML elements also have user-facing benefits with forms of technology I'm likely not familiar with (screen readers).
  5. I learned that some forms of technology don't support the user-facing benefits in the same way (details/summary arrow being announced as a triangle).
  6. I learned that alternate HTML declarations work better (ARIA disclosure pattern).
-->

These interactive things are the most important parts of <abbr>HTML</abbr>. These are the things that truly break or make a site. If you don’t use these elements properly, many people are actively excluded and the <abbr>UX</abbr> degrades in many ways. The interactive elements are what makes the web the web. 

<!-- Eric: I really enjoyed the flipping of "make or break" to "break or make". -->

## The old focus on semantics

Every time I come home from a web conference I hang the lanyard with the badge on a doorknob. There are at least 35 lanyards there. The oldest is more than fifteen years old, the newest just a few months. On most of these conferences there was someone telling us about the importance of using proper *semantic <abbr>HTML</abbr>*. And they *all* talked about the importance of heading levels. So for *at least* 15 years we’ve been telling the web design and web development community that heading levels are very important. Yet after all these years, and after all these conferences [there are almost no websites that do it right](https://webaim.org/projects/million/#headings). 

Later, when <abbr>HTML</abbr>5 was introduced the talks about semantics were still mostly about creating a proper document outline, but this time with sectioning elements in combination with headings. Unfortunately this idea was never properly implemented by browsers. And it turned out that these sectioning elements are very hard to understand. For years I’ve tried to explain the difference between a section and an article, and almost nobody gets it. And of course they don’t, because it’s very, very complicated theory. And above all: There’s no clear <abbr>UX</abbr> feature to point at. The user experience doesn’t change dramatically if you use a section instead of an article. It’s *mostly* theoretical. So nowadays, next to *divitis*, we also have *[sectionitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/1it5aa/is_sectionitis_the_new_divitis/).* 

<!-- Manuel: 
1. "very, very complicated theory" <- please consider linking to this extensive post about the difference: https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/07/article-section-elements-accessibility/
2. "There’s no clear UX feature to point at" <- Not really true because if you give a section an accessible name via aria-label or aria-labelleby you're turning it into a landmark. -->

Understanding how heading levels work is hard. And understanding how sectioning elements work is really hard. And explaining these things is even harder. What’s the use for [theoretical purity](https://www.w3.org/TR/HTML-design-principles/#priority-of-constituencies) if the end result is the same?

<!-- Eric: You've touched on a really interesting point here, where we can reflect the Priority of Constituencies back at its creators. I'm not sure if it's in the scope of this post specifically, but what do you do when users, authors, implementors, and likely specifiers are all aligned in confusion because of this complication? -->

Yes, of course I know that some sectioning elements actually have some <abbr>UX</abbr> attached to it. But not that much <abbr>UX</abbr> if you compare it to the real interactive elements. Not getting your heading levels right is not at all as destructive as using divs instead of links. 

<!-- Eric: Not sure if we need "of course", in that the reader does not know you. -->

Now, I’m not saying that we should stop teaching people about heading levels. We shouldn’t. But we should think about *when* we teach them these more complicated parts of <abbr>HTML</abbr>. First we need to get people exited about <abbr>HTML</abbr> by showing all the free yet complicated layers of <abbr>UX</abbr> you get when you use the interactive elements properly. And then, when they do understand the interactive elements, when they’re really excited and they ask for more, show them the more obscure <abbr>UX</abbr> patterns, like [the option to nagivate through the headings on the page](https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey9/#finding) with a screen reader. First start with the obvious, then show the details.

I am very much looking forward to 15 more years of web conferences. I look forward to seeing inspiring talks about the <abbr>UX</abbr> of <abbr>HTML</abbr>. Talks about the incredible radio button and its unique *indeterminate* state! Talks about validating forms in a friendly way with just <abbr>HTML</abbr> and some clever <abbr title="Cascading StyleSheets">CSS</abbr>. Talks about the different context menus that appear on different elements. In other words, talks about what <abbr>HTML</abbr> *does*, and much less about what it *means in theory*. Let’s talk about user experience, and let’s stop talking about semantics and shit.

<!-- Manuel: "radio button and its unique *indeterminate* state" <- first of all. I didn't know that the indeterminate also applies to radios. TIL, thanks. second, aren't checkboxes the much cooler and more obvious example for the indeterminate state?  -->

<!-- Manuel: "Let’s talk about user experience, and let’s stop talking about semantics and shit" <- 
As a teacher, I absolutely agree. This way of approaching code quality, UX and accessibility will much better resonate with students who're just getting starting with web dev and it will also make accessibility tangiable and approachable.
As someone who's concerened about the inaccessibility of the web and the lack of competance in our industry to build inclusive sites, I'm afraid that putting semantics - and with it accessibility - completely under the roof of UX, decreases its importance and contributes to its invisibility. talking about UX and not about inclusion or disability may eventually put the focus even more on the alleged majority -->

<!-- Eric: Another thought that I'm unsure if is in the scope of this post or not: Taking a full four years of university classes to get a web job is still somewhat of a rarity in the parts of the industry I'm familiar with. How can we extend the teaching of the user-facing benefits to people who don't enter into the industry through an academic pathway? -->
